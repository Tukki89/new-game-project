Siegfried: You’ve been quiet, Luther. Most men would have something to say about these rumors.
Luther: Aye, my lord. But talk and truth are different things.
Siegfried: So you don’t believe it?
Luther: I believe in the forest. I believe in the way it changes when something unnatural lingers. And I believe in the way men return different than when they left.
Siegfried: Different how?
Luther: Some come back shaken, like Roderich. Others don’t come back at all.
Siegfried: You think something’s hunting them?
Luther: If it is, it’s not using fangs or claws. Men vanish without a sound, without a struggle. No blood, no torn cloth, no tracks to follow. Just gone.
Siegfried: And yet Roderich returned.
Luther: Aye. Wounded, but alive. That means one of two things. Either he was let go… or he escaped when he wasn’t meant to.
Siegfried: You believe this woman—this creature—is taking them?
Luther: I believe something is. Whether it’s the woman, the swan, or something deeper in those woods… I don’t know. But whatever it is, it’s watching us.
Siegfried: Watching?
Luther: You ever get that feeling? The hair on your neck rising, the weight of unseen eyes? Some nights, it lingers at the edge of camp. A presence. A whisper in the wind, a shift in the trees when there’s no breeze.
Siegfried: And yet, no one has caught it.
Luther: No one who’s lived to tell.
Siegfried: Then how do you know it’s real?
Luther: Because I’ve felt it. And because the dead don’t get to argue.
Siegfried: So what do you think she is?
Luther: Not a ghost. Not a demon. Something older. The kind of thing men once feared before they had walls to hide behind.
Siegfried: And what would it want?
Luther: That, my lord, is the question that keeps me up at night.
