(The castle doors groan as they open, heavy and deliberate. Siegfried steps out, and the rush of open air greets him. It is crisp, unburdened by the weight of duty that clings to the halls behind him. He stops, taking in the vast sky above—an expanse without walls, without limits. He breathes in deeply, relishing the simple freedom of stepping beyond the confines of stone and expectation.)
(His moment is short-lived. Two familiar figures approach—Mikhal and Thiery. They walk with the ease of men who have stood beside him for years. Though guards by duty, their presence is not as rigid as the rest. They know him, not just as a prince, but as a man.)
Mikhal: Hah. If I didn’t know better, I’d say you were tasting fresh air for the first time in years.
Thiery: You certainly look like a man who’s just shaken off his chains.
Siegfried: Perhaps because I have. If only for a moment.
Mikhal: A moment’s freedom is better than none at all.
Thiery: Though from the look of you, I’d wager your mind is still weighed down.
Mikhal: And we’ve heard why. The king summoned you.
Thiery: And from your face, I take it you didn’t much like what he had to say.
(Siegfried exhales sharply, running a hand through his hair. There is no use in hiding his thoughts—not from them.)
Siegfried: Then you already know. The king has decided my future, as if it were his to command like an army on a battlefield.
Mikhal: That you are to marry. That duty demands it.
Thiery: As though duty is the only thing a man is meant to live for.
Siegfried: So it seems.
Mikhal: A prince’s fate is carved before he’s even old enough to lift a blade. I suppose that is the way of things.
Thiery: Doesn’t mean it’s right.
Mikhal: No. But right or wrong hardly matters when the world moves as it always has.
Thiery: [Pauses for a moment, then speaks with quiet honesty.] I wish I had the power to change my fate.
(Siegfried looks at him, surprised by the rare admission. Thiery, ever the practical one, ever the dutiful soldier. And yet, here he stands, speaking words that are so close to Siegfried’s own thoughts that they feel like an echo.)
Thiery: I won’t pretend to understand the weight you carry, my lord. But I will say this—I wish you success in whatever you seek. Whatever it is you truly want.
Mikhal: A rare thing, to be able to reach for what you desire instead of what is expected of you. If you have even the slimmest chance, I hope you take it.
(Siegfried studies them both, then gives a small, almost imperceptible nod.)
Siegfried: That is a wish I will not take lightly.
(He lets their words settle before shaking his head slightly, shifting the conversation.)
Siegfried: But enough of this. There are other matters to tend to. I have decided to visit the soldiers' camp.
Thiery: The one by the forest?
Siegfried: Yes. I plan to speak with them. And beyond that… I wish to train. To clear my mind. Perhaps find solitude where the weight of expectation cannot follow.
(The guards exchange a glance. A hesitation—subtle, but there.)
Mikhal: Hm. If it’s solitude you seek, the forest may give it… but be wary.
Thiery: There have been… rumors. Uneasy ones.
Siegfried: Rumors? Of what?
Mikhal: A creature. One that moves like a shadow, neither beast nor woman, yet both.
Thiery: Some say it watches from the edges of the trees, waiting. Others say it lures men deeper into the woods, far from where they can be found.
Siegfried: And those who follow?
Mikhal: Some return, but they speak little of what they saw. Others… do not return at all.
Thiery: It could be nothing. Just campfire tales meant to keep recruits from wandering too far.
Mikhal: Or it could be something. There’s a reason the men are uneasy. They won’t say it outright, but I see it in their eyes.
Siegfried: No clear sightings? No real details?
Thiery: None that can be trusted. Only whispers and warnings.
(Siegfried listens, thoughtful. The weight of duty still clings to him, but this—this is different. A mystery. A question left unanswered. A welcome distraction.)
Siegfried: Then it would be best for me to hear it from the men themselves.
Mikhal: A wise choice. Soldiers speak differently to one of their own than they do to their superiors. You may learn more by listening than by questioning.
Thiery: And if there’s truly something lurking in those woods, better to know what kind of danger you might be walking into.
Siegfried: Then I will make my way there.
(He steps forward, past the guards, toward the forest camp. The castle, its walls, and the burdens within them fade behind him as he walks forward—toward whatever truth awaits.)
