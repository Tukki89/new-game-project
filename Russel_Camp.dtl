Siegfried: You there—Russell, was it?
Russell: Aye, my lord. What can I do for you?
Siegfried: I heard talk of something in the woods. A woman. Or something that looks like one.
Russell: You’ve heard right. But if you're asking for certainty, you won’t find it here. Only stories and uneasy men.
Siegfried: Uneasy men don’t whisper about nothing. Tell me what you know.
Russell: It started a few weeks back. Strange sightings at the edge of the forest. Men reported seeing a woman—pale as the moon, hair like spun gold. She doesn’t speak. Doesn’t move. Just stands there, watching.
Siegfried: And when they approach?
Russell: She disappears. Not like someone running into the trees. Like she was never there to begin with.
Siegfried: And yet, she returns.
Russell: Aye. Sometimes for days, sometimes only for moments. But never in the same place twice.
Siegfried: And no one has followed her?
Russell: Some have tried. One man even swore he almost reached her. But the moment he got close, it was as if the whole forest turned against him.
Siegfried: How so?
Russell: Roots tangled his feet. Branches moved when there was no wind. He swore something gripped his chest—tight as a vice, like the air itself didn’t want him near.
Siegfried: And he escaped?
Russell: Barely. Said he felt like he was being pushed away. Like the forest itself spat him out.
Siegfried: And this woman… do you believe she’s real?
Russell: My lord, I believe in what I see. And I’ve seen things in those woods that no man should.
