Siegfried: Slimes. As far as obstacles go, I could have asked for worse.

Siegfried: They’re a problem for farmers and merchants, but for me? Hardly worth drawing my blade.

Siegfried: Still, it wouldn’t hurt to cut down a few. It’s been some time since I’ve had a proper fight.

Siegfried: Though, if this is the worst Duskwither Hollow has to offer, then its reputation is undeserved.

Siegfried: No lingering presence. No watching eyes. No strange sounds carried by the wind.

Siegfried: If there was ever something unnatural here, it’s long gone.

Siegfried: Roderich spoke of a woman—one moment there, the next gone. But the part that lingers with me… is the swan.

Siegfried: A creature that doesn’t belong here, far from lakes and rivers. He suspected a connection.

Siegfried: If that’s true, then whatever it is… it has no reason to stay in a place as mundane as this.

Siegfried: No, if it’s real, then it would be somewhere deeper. Somewhere the world bends.

Siegfried: The Enchanted Forest.

Siegfried: Mikhal and Thierry would urge me to turn back. Even Luther, despite his lack of superstition, would tell me caution is wisdom.

Siegfried: But there’s no caution in standing still. No wisdom in ignoring the unknown.

Siegfried: Gallard would say my duty lies elsewhere. That this is a waste of time.

Siegfried: Brunhilde would understand the need to seek something beyond what’s given.

Siegfried: And Waldheim… well, he’d say the only truth that matters is the one I carve for myself.

Siegfried: Maybe this is all just another way to avoid what’s waiting for me back home.

Siegfried: A throne. A duty. A wife of my father’s choosing.

Siegfried: But if I’m to make decisions that shape my future, I need to know what I truly want.

Siegfried: Maybe, just maybe, the answers I seek are waiting beyond these trees.

Siegfried: I’ll press on.
