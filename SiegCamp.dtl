Siegfried: Finally. No walls. No throne. Just open air.
Siegfried: It feels different here. The air is heavier… but clearer at the same time.
Siegfried: The guards spoke of something lurking. A creature that takes the shape of a woman.
Siegfried: A soldier’s tale to keep restless men from wandering too far… or is there more to it?
Siegfried: Either way, fear always has a root. No one speaks of ghosts unless they've seen the shadow of one.
Siegfried: No grand welcomes. No fanfare. Just steel and sweat. I prefer it this way.
Siegfried: But before I step into the trees, I should speak with the soldiers. They’ve seen more than whispers.
Siegfried: If there's truth to the rumors, they would know. If it's just campfire talk, I should know that too.
Siegfried: I didn’t come here just to listen to rumors. I came to move. To fight. To think—without voices pulling me in different directions.
Siegfried: If the forest holds something… then let it come. I won’t turn away.
Siegfried: I’ll find my own answers.
