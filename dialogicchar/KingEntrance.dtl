[King]
King: Ah, my son, you've arrived. I summoned you because an important matter must be discussed. You are of the right age now, and as your father and king, it is my duty to ensure the continuation of our lineage. It is time for you to take a wife.

[Siegfried]
Father, I respect your concern, but I do not need you to choose a wife for me. I will decide on my own when the time is right.

[King]
I expected such a response. You have always been strong-willed, but this is not merely a personal choice. It is a duty. The kingdom must have a secure future, and a union with the right family could strengthen our position.

[Siegfried]
And what of my happiness? Must I surrender my life to a loveless duty, shackled to a stranger for the sake of alliances?

[King]
You think too much with your heart and not enough with your mind. A wise ruler does not indulge in selfish whims.

[Siegfried]
Then you would have me be nothing more than a tool? A pawn in your endless game of politics?

[King]
You are my son, my heir. Your duty is heavier than the wishes of your heart. A marriage is more than love, my son. It is the binding of houses, the securing of our dominion, and the preservation of our legacy.

[Siegfried]
You speak as if love is an indulgence. Is it not the foundation of strong rule? A kingdom built on alliances alone is brittle.

[King]
Alliances have preserved this realm for generations. A ruler cannot afford to be blinded by emotion.

[Siegfried]
And what if I choose to forge my own path? To find love and still rule with strength?

[King]
If you defy tradition, you risk weakening the kingdom. The nobles will not take kindly to a marriage of passion over prudence.

[Siegfried]
Then let them disapprove. I will prove that strength does not come from arranged unions, but from conviction.

[King]
Conviction alone does not secure a throne. You will learn this in time.

[Siegfried]
If learning means forsaking my heart, then I want no part of it.

[King]
You are still young, reckless. Your vision is narrow.

[Siegfried]
And yours is outdated. The world changes, father. You would have me live in the past.

[King]
I would have you rule wisely. If you insist on your own way, then show me it will not bring ruin.

[Siegfried]
I will, in my own time, on my own terms.

[King]
You are my son. No matter how much you resist, you cannot escape the weight of your birthright.

[Siegfried]
I do not seek to escape it, only to carry it differently.

[King]
Then do so wisely. I will not stand by and watch you dismantle what generations have built.

[Siegfried]
My choice will define the future, not destroy it.

[King]
We shall see.

[Siegfried]
So this is how it will be. Father believes he can decide my fate, push me into a marriage for the good of the realm. But I am no mere piece on his board, and I will not dance to his tune.

[Siegfried]
Meet his candidates. Listen to noble daughters prattle about duty and expectations. No. That is not the life I seek. I belong elsewhere, among those who truly know what it means to fight for something real.

[Siegfried]
The soldiers in the camp—they are the ones who understand me. The battlefield is where I find purpose, not in the halls of the palace, bound by politics and false smiles. If I must marry one day, it will be on my terms, not because of some political maneuvering.

[Siegfried]
I will go to the camp. The men there do not care for titles or noble bloodlines. They respect action, strength, and loyalty. That is where I belong, at least for now. The King will expect me to play along, but I have no intention of doing so.

[Siegfried]
Let him watch me all he wants. I will not be caged by duty. My path is my own.

[Siegfried]
He speaks of responsibility, but does he understand what it truly means? Duty is not just about making alliances. It is about being there, standing with those who fight, bleeding with those who suffer. That is the duty I choose to uphold.

[Siegfried]
He tells me I am young. That I do not understand. But I understand well enough.

[Siegfried]
The people do not care for royal marriages. They care for the leaders who fight for them.

[Siegfried]
I have seen how the people struggle. How the soldiers give their lives. That is where my concern lies.

[Siegfried]
A wife chosen for politics means nothing if I cannot look her in the eyes and see an equal.

[Siegfried]
If I am to be king one day, I will be a king who walks among his men, not above them.

[Siegfried]
Titles, banners, noble bloodlines. They mean nothing when steel meets flesh on the battlefield.

[Siegfried]
My father does not see it, but the world is changing. Rulers must change with it, or be left behind.

[Siegfried]
And when the time comes, I will find a wife of my choosing. Not one selected from a list of alliances, but one who truly understands me. One who will stand beside me, not because she was told to, but because she chooses to.

[Siegfried]
Not a queen made by politics, but a queen made by choice. That is my decision.

[Siegfried]
And no one—not even the king—will change that.

[Siegfried]
Tomorrow, I leave for the camp. There, I will train, fight, and learn more about my people. Let the nobles whisper, let the court grow uneasy. I do not care.

[Siegfried]
The battlefield does not lie. There is no pretense there, no deception. Only strength, courage, and the will to stand tall.

[Siegfried]
Father may try to steer me toward his vision of the future, but he will soon realize that I am not so easily swayed.

[Siegfried]
A throne is not just a seat of power. It is a burden, one that must be carried with honor, not bound by outdated traditions.

[Siegfried]
A ruler must listen to their people, understand their worries, and learn what they expect before forging their own path.
