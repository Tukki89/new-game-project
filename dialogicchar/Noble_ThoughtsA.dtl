Siegfried: Gallard, I need to hear your thoughts. My father has made his stance clear, but I want to know yours. What do you think of what he told me?
Gallard: Your father speaks as a king should. His duty is to the kingdom first, above all else.
Siegfried: And you agree with him? That I must set aside my own desires for the sake of alliances?
Gallard: It is not about agreement. It is about reality. A ruler’s heart is not his own. It belongs to his people.
Siegfried: Then a ruler must be nothing more than a servant to duty? A man who follows, never choosing for himself?
Gallard: Choice exists. But rare is the man who gets what he truly wants. Your father was fortunate—he married the woman he adored. But do not mistake fortune for expectation. Most of us are not granted such luxuries.
Siegfried: Then what is the point? To live without happiness, without passion?
Gallard: A ruler does not live for himself. He carries the weight of the crown, the weight of his people. His happiness is a sacrifice, one that ensures the kingdom endures.
Siegfried: You speak as if love is a weakness. As if it has no place in rule.
Gallard: Love is not weakness. But it is unpredictable. A kingdom cannot be built on something so fragile.
Siegfried: And yet, a ruler without love rules only through fear and duty. Is that strength?
Gallard: Strength is ensuring stability. A marriage bound by alliance is not without its own form of loyalty.
Siegfried: But loyalty and love are not the same. One is duty. The other is choice.
Gallard: And duty must always come before choice. That is the burden of the crown.
Siegfried: Then tell me, Gallard—what of the kingdom itself? You have served for years. You have seen its strengths and weaknesses. Do you believe we are strong? Or do we only cling to old traditions, afraid to change?
Gallard: Strength and tradition are woven together. Cast one aside, and the other falters. But I have seen the fractures, Siegfried. I have heard the whispers of discontent.
Siegfried: Then why do we not act? Why do we not change?
Gallard: Because change is dangerous. Too much, too fast, and you will have more enemies than allies. A wise ruler walks a fine line between progress and preservation.
Siegfried:  And where do you stand on duty and love? If you were in my place, what would you choose?\

Gallard: I am not you. My life has been built on service, on duty. Love was never an option. But if I had the chance… I do not know.
Siegfried: You hesitate.
Gallard: Because I understand the weight of both paths. One grants security. The other… uncertainty. And uncertainty is dangerous.
Siegfried: And yet, isn’t uncertainty where true strength is tested? Where leaders prove their worth?
Gallard: Perhaps. But leaders who gamble with uncertainty often pay a high price.
Then you would have me follow the path set before me. Marry for duty. Sacrifice what I want for the sake of stability.
I would have you make a choice you can live with. One you will not regret when the crown is heavy and there is no turning back.
No turning back…
You are young, Siegfried. You see the world in possibilities. But a king must see it in consequences.
And what of freedom? Does a king have no right to choose his own fate?
A king’s fate is tied to his kingdom. His freedom is an illusion.
Then what is the purpose of power, if not to shape the world as we see fit?
Power does not belong to the ruler. It belongs to those who depend on him.
And what if those who depend on him suffer because he follows tradition instead of his own convictions?
Then he must weigh which suffering is greater—the pain of change, or the ruin of instability.
And if I find a way to rule without sacrificing my heart?
Then you will be a rare king indeed.
My father told me happiness is fleeting. That duty is eternal.
He is not wrong. But happiness, however fleeting, is still real. The question is, will you chase it? Or will you shoulder the weight of what is expected?
Must it be one or the other? Can I not find both?
Few have. Fewer still have succeeded. But if you believe you are different… prove it.
I intend to.
Then be prepared for the cost.

Gallard speaks with wisdom, but also with resignation.
As if the path before me is already written.
He tells me my father was lucky.
That most never get what they truly want.
He calls love unpredictable.
But is duty truly so certain?
He sees change as dangerous.
But isn't stagnation just as deadly?
I understand his wisdom.
But I refuse to accept that happiness must be abandoned for the sake of the throne.
If a king cannot live by his own will…
Then what kind of ruler is he?
Gallard believes a ruler’s heart does not belong to him.
That it is a sacrifice to be made for the people.
But I believe a ruler must have a heart first.
Otherwise, what is he ruling for?
I will not be a prisoner of duty alone.
I will find my own way.
