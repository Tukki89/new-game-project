Siegfried: So this is the Enchanted Forest. It feels… different. The air is thick, heavy with something unseen. The land itself feels aware. Watching.

Siegfried: Duskwither Hollow was nothing compared to this. Just slimes and overgrown paths. Here, though… there’s something else. Something waiting.

Siegfried: I see no swan, no ghostly woman. But that does not mean they are not here. The stories, the warnings—they came from somewhere.

Siegfried: Russel was certain it was just a tale, Luther spoke of superstition, and Roderich… Roderich saw something. And paid the price for it.

Siegfried: And then there is Lord Waldheim, who would call this all just another thread in the great web of power. Gallard, who would weigh this against duty. Brunhilde, who would ask if I had chosen this path or if it was chosen for me.

Siegfried: But what do I believe? What is it I am truly searching for here?

???: You tread a path uncertain, yet your heart is heavy with purpose.

Siegfried: Who’s there? Show yourself. If you have words to speak, do so where I can see you.

???: Would seeing me change the truth of my words?

Siegfried: It would make you real.

???: Real? As real as the duty you question? As real as the chains you wish to break?

Siegfried: You speak as if you know me.

???: I know the weight you carry. The doubt that lingers even as you walk forward. You wish for clarity, yet you fear the answer.

Siegfried: I fear nothing.

???: Then why do your footsteps waver?

Siegfried: Enough riddles. If you know so much, then tell me—what is this place? Why does it feel… alive?

???: Because it is. The Enchanted Forest does not merely exist; it breathes, it listens, it remembers.

Siegfried: Then tell me what it remembers.

???: It remembers those who came seeking, as you do. Some sought wisdom. Some sought power. Some sought an escape from the world that bound them. And some… were never meant to leave.

Siegfried: And which am I?

???: That is for you to decide. But hear this, Prince of the Realm: The deeper you go, the less the world you knew will matter. The deeper you go, the more you must ask—what is it you truly seek?

Siegfried: I seek understanding.

???: Understanding… or absolution?

Siegfried: …What do you mean?

???: You walk with the burden of a crown not yet placed upon your head. You question your fate, but fate does not question you. If you wish to know the truth, then you must be ready to bear its weight.

Siegfried: Then I will.

???: Will you? Even if the truth demands a price you are not ready to pay?

Siegfried: Whatever price it is, it will be mine to bear.

???: Then step forward, young prince. The forest watches… and it will decide if you are worthy of the answers you seek.

Siegfried: Then let it judge me. I will not turn back.
