Siegfried walks through the aftermath of battle, his sword still slick with the remnants of the
slimes he had just slain. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and something
else, something unnatural.
Then, through the trees, he sees her.
The swan.
Except she is not a swan anymore.
Where white feathers once adorned her, now stands a woman—pale as moonlight, her golden
hair cascading down her back. Her dress clings to her, soaked from the transformation. And her
eyes… they are wide with something between fear and disbelief.
Siegfried: My lady—are you alright?
Odette gasps, taking a half step back. Her hands clench into fists at her sides, as if unsure
whether to flee or fight.
Odette: Y-Yes. I mean—Prince—ah, I mean… I… I do not know what to call you.
Siegfried chuckles lightly, though his gaze remains steady.
Siegfried: No need to stumble over titles. Just Siegfried is fine.
Odette: Siegfried… I see.
Siegfried: And you? Do you have a name, or shall I continue calling you 'mystical creature
lurking in the forest'?
Odette’s lips part in surprise before she lets out the faintest, breathy laugh. It is short-lived, but
Siegfried notices.
Odette: My name is Odette.
Siegfried: A fitting name for a lady with such grace, though I imagine you hear that often.
Odette: Hardly. I do not speak to many outside of… the garden.
Siegfried: Garden?
Odette hesitates, then shakes her head.
Odette: It is nothing.
Siegfried watches her carefully. There is something fragile about the way she stands—not
physically, but in spirit. A woman who has spent too long looking over her shoulder.
Siegfried: Odette, forgive me for being blunt, but what was that all about?
Odette stiffens.
Siegfried: You transformed from a swan into a human. Are you a magician? Or something else
entirely?
Siegfried: There have been rumors of mystical creatures in the forest. My men have seen
glimpses of women… and a swan, though swans are not native to these woods.
Siegfried: Are you the one behind the disappearances?
Odette’s face falls, hurt flashing in her expression.
Odette: No! Those were not me… but my guides. Or rather, the ones who came before me.
Siegfried furrows his brows.
Siegfried: Guides?
Odette: Former humans… women who suffered the same curse I bear now.
Siegfried’s grip on his sword tightens slightly. He does not like the sound of that word. Curse.
Siegfried: A curse… placed by Rothbart.
Odette nods slowly.
Odette: Every woman he has ever taken interest in… every woman who has refused him… has
suffered this fate.
Siegfried: And only he knows the answer to undoing it.
Odette: Yes. He holds our freedom in his hands and calls it mercy.
Siegfried exhales sharply. The weight of her words settles on him like a heavy cloak.
Siegfried: And these women… the ones turned before you. They fought to escape?
Odette: They fled, as I did. But none of us can truly escape. Not while he still breathes.
Siegfried studies her face, seeing the way her voice wavers despite her composure. She has
been fighting for far longer than he can even imagine.
Siegfried: You have spent too long fighting alone, haven’t you?
Odette flinches, caught off guard. She does not answer, but she does not need to.
Siegfried: I do not know what lies ahead, but I do know this—I will not stand aside while a man
like Rothbart twists lives into chains.
Odette: You do not know the weight of what you offer.
Siegfried: And he does not know the weight of my resolve.
Odette: You are willing to risk yourself for a stranger?
Siegfried: You are not a stranger. Not anymore.
Odette lowers her gaze. A prince. A noble. And yet, unlike any she has met before. He does not
speak of possession, of winning, of claiming. He speaks of choice.
Odette: If you stand against him, he will see you as an enemy.
Siegfried: Then let him.
Odette’s breath catches. No hesitation. No fear.
Siegfried turns, staring into the darkness of the enchanted forest ahead.
Siegfried: This place is soaked in sorrow. It lingers in the trees, in the wind.
Odette: It is the weight of those who have fallen before us.
Siegfried: Then let us not be among them.
Silence stretches between them, filled only by the distant rustling of leaves. Then, quietly,
Odette speaks.
Odette: What do you gain from this?
Siegfried looks at her, his gaze steady.
Siegfried: Maybe the same thing you seek. Answers. A way forward.
Siegfried: I do not know where this road will lead, but if I walk it alone, I will find nothing.
Odette meets his gaze, something unreadable in her expression. She does not trust easily. She
cannot afford to. But in this moment, with this man who speaks of burdens he never asked for…
For the first time in years, she wonders—
Could she truly fight for more than just survival?
Could she fight to be free?
