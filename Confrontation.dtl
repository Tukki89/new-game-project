Rothbart: You saw it, didn’t you? The moment she shed her wings and became human once more. The secret that should have remained hidden.
Rothbart: You should not have seen it. Now you will die here.
No! Please, help me!
I do not want this! I do not want him!
I will not marry you, Rothbart! I will not be bound to you!
Rothbart: Silence!
Rothbart: Your life is mine. Your future is mine to decide. I am the only one capable of lifting your curse.
Rothbart: Without my power, your transformation will become permanent. You will bear the shame of your bloodline—a mere creature, neither woman nor swan, forever trapped between worlds.
Rothbart: A stain your family could never wash away. A disgrace your mother and father would never bear.
And yet they would still love me more than you ever could.
You do not wish to save me! You wish to own me!
Rothbart: And you would throw away salvation out of stubbornness?
I would rather be cursed than live as your prisoner!
Rothbart: Foolish girl. You think you have a choice?
Siegfried: She does.
Siegfried: And you will not force or threaten her any further.
Rothbart: And you will not decide what happens here, prince. You have no place in this.
Rothbart: But since you insist on playing the hero, let me show you the weight of your defiance.
The ground shifts, and the air grows heavy. The slimes that had been lurking nearby stir, drawn to the dark energy. Siegfried tightens his stance, ready for a fight.
Rothbart begins chanting a spell, the wind howls—then, a whisper cuts through the air, a voice neither his nor Siegfried’s.
Patience, Rothbart… what is yours will come to you in due time. Do not chase them. They will find their way back to you.
Rothbart hesitates, his expression darkening, but he lowers his hand. The magic dissipates. The slimes remain, their sluggish movements filling the tense silence.
Rothbart: Hmph. A lesson in restraint. Very well.
Siegfried: Who are you talking to?
Rothbart: That is none of your concern.
Siegfried: You speak as if you know me.
Rothbart: I know what you are. A prince bound by chains he does not yet see. You think yourself free, defiant, capable of standing against the will of others. But you are not.
Rothbart: You are no different from her. A fate decided long before you could fight it. A life carved out for you without your say.
Rothbart: And just like her, you will come to learn—no matter how hard you resist, the world will not bend to you. You are not capable of changing your fate.
Rothbart: Not yet.
Rothbart turns, his form fading into the mist, his presence lingering even as he vanishes. The slimes twitch and stir, creeping closer.
Siegfried clenches his fists, Rothbart’s words lingering in his mind. His jaw tightens—but then, movement.
Siegfried: Damn it. No time for this.
Siegfried: Princess, run! Now!
The slimes lurch forward, drawn by the tension. Siegfried steps between them and the princess, sword in hand, ready to clear a path.
