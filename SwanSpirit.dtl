As Siegfried reaches the end of the enchanted forest, the dense trees give way to open air. A mist lingers over the ground, swirling unnaturally. The silence here is thick, almost suffocating. Then, from within the mist, figures begin to take shape—swans, but not ordinary ones. Their eyes gleam with intelligence, and their presence feels… watching. Waiting.

Siegfried slows his steps, hand instinctively hovering over the hilt of his sword.

Siegfried: I was warned of creatures lurking in this forest, but I did not expect to be met with silence.

The swans do not move. Then, one of them—a larger one with feathers that seem to shimmer like moonlight—speaks, though its beak does not move.

Swan Spirit: Silence is the voice of the forgotten. The remnants of stories left untold.

Siegfried stiffens, eyes narrowing.

Siegfried: And who are you to speak of such things?

Swan Spirit: One who has seen many stories written in the blood of men like you.

The mist thickens, curling around Siegfried’s feet. He feels something stir inside him, something deeper than fear.

Siegfried: You know who I am. Then speak plainly—what is it you want from me?

Swan Spirit: It is not what we want. It is what you seek.

Siegfried exhales sharply, frustration lacing his voice.

Siegfried: If you know what I seek, then tell me.

The spirit tilts its head, its glowing eyes steady.

Swan Spirit: Iron and burden. That is what you carry, is it not?

Siegfried’s brows furrow.

Siegfried: Iron and burden…?

Swan Spirit: Is that not the weight upon your shoulders, Prince?

Siegfried: I carry a sword. I carry duty. But what do you mean by burden?

Swan Spirit: The weight of expectation. The chains of a name. The path carved before you, not by your own hand, but by those who came before.

Siegfried exhales slowly.

Siegfried: And what of iron?

Swan Spirit: Strength, forged in fire. A weapon, wielded by those who seek to rule. A cage, for those who do not.

Siegfried clenches his jaw.

Siegfried: You speak in riddles.

Swan Spirit: And yet, you understand.

The mist swirls again, and for a brief moment, the forms of the swans flicker—human shapes overlapping with feathered bodies, as if they exist between two worlds. Siegfried grips his sword but does not draw it.

Siegfried: You say I carry iron and burden. Then tell me… am I the wielder or the caged?

The Swan Spirit’s gaze deepens, unreadable.

Swan Spirit: That is for you to decide. But beware, Prince—iron can be reforged, and burdens can break. Which will you become?

Siegfried is silent. His fingers curl, then release.

Siegfried: I came seeking truth. Not prophecy.

Swan Spirit: Then step forward, and see for yourself.

The mist begins to recede, revealing the lake ahead. The air feels different here—charged, expectant. Something waits beyond. The weight of his choices presses heavier on Siegfried’s shoulders, but he does not hesitate. He moves forward.
