Siegfried: Duskwither Hollow… A name carved from unease. A place where the light fades before its time, where the wind carries whispers instead of silence. Even standing at its edge, I feel its weight.
Siegfried: Yet, despite the name, the path ahead is not impossible. The trees do not reach out to ensnare me. The ground beneath my feet does not crumble into abyss. It is just a forest… or so I tell myself.
Siegfried: The real challenge lies beyond this hollow—the Enchanted Forest. A place where certainty fades, where men have wandered and never returned.
Siegfried: Roderich strayed too far. He thought he could chase down a phantom, unravel its mystery with sheer will alone. But something stopped him. Something unseen, something he could not fight. He returned not with answers, but with wounds—marks not left by blade or beast.
Siegfried: He spoke of a woman. And a swan. One shifting into the other, bound together in a way that defies nature. The swan should not be here—this is not its home. And yet, there it was, lingering where it should not be.
Siegfried: Luther spoke carefully, measuring his words. He is not a man given to panic, yet even he carries doubt. He believes the forest is watching. That it is not just trees and wind, but something more. Something aware.
Siegfried: Russel, ever the skeptic, dismisses it as imagination running wild. To him, it is a tale stretched too thin by fear, a shadow mistaken for a monster. Yet even he cannot explain the wounds Roderich bears, nor the unnatural presence of a swan in these woods.
Siegfried: A creature that shifts between forms, neither bound by flesh nor reason. Is it a myth come to life? Or something that has always been here, simply unnoticed until now?
Siegfried: And the nobles… I can already hear their voices in my mind.
Siegfried: Gallard would demand proof. Cold logic, hard evidence. He would see this as a matter of duty, a puzzle to be solved for the kingdom’s sake. He would ask what I intend to do with what I find.
Siegfried: Brunhilde would not waste time on the ‘why.’ She would ask only what. What force lurks in these woods? What challenge does it pose? Would it yield to steel and will, or is this a battle that must be fought another way?
Siegfried: And Waldheim… He would smirk, amused by my search for answers in a place designed to deny them. He would remind me that stories are only as powerful as the belief behind them. That truth is a matter of perspective, and that whatever I find may not be what I expect.
Siegfried: And he would be right to say so.
Siegfried: Why am I here? What am I truly searching for?
Siegfried: My father calls it duty, the weight every ruler must bear. To him, a prince does not question the path before him—he walks it, no matter where it leads.
Siegfried: But is that all there is to a ruler? To simply follow the footsteps of the dead? To obey without question?
Siegfried: If I live by duty alone, then am I truly alive? Or merely carrying the weight of those before me, a chain passed from father to son, unbroken?
Siegfried: I do not know what awaits me in this forest. I do not know if I will find a beast, a woman, or nothing at all.
Siegfried: But if something lingers here, if there is something beyond the stories, then I will face it. Not as a prince searching for purpose. Not as a noble bound by duty.
Siegfried: But as myself.
Siegfried: I will not turn away. Not from fear. Not from illusion.
Siegfried: Not from fate.
