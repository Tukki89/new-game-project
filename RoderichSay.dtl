Siegfried: Roderich. The men say you’ve seen it.
Roderich: Aye… if seeing is what you’d call it.
Siegfried: Tell me. From the beginning.
Roderich: I was on patrol. The forest was still. Too still. Even the wind seemed afraid to pass through. Then, ahead of me… I saw her.
Siegfried: The woman?
Roderich: Pale as fresh snow. Hair like gold thread. She was standing by the river, her feet just touching the water.
Siegfried: And she saw you?
Roderich: I don’t know. She didn’t turn. Didn’t move. Just stood there.
Siegfried: And you approached?
Roderich: I had to. I stepped forward, but the air turned thick—like wading through unseen currents. My limbs felt heavier with each step, as if something was pushing me back.
Siegfried: But you kept going.
Roderich: Aye. Then I saw it.
Siegfried: Saw what?
Roderich: A swan. White as bone. Watching from the riverbank. It shouldn’t have been there, my lord. No swans live in these woods.
Siegfried: And then?
Roderich: The wind howled. Not a natural gust, but a sound. Like voices carried through a storm. The trees groaned, the ground shifted, and something pulled me back.
Siegfried: Pulled?
Roderich: I don’t know what it was. Hands? Shadows? The air itself? But it threw me to the ground like a rag. Next thing I knew, I was on the forest floor, gasping for breath. The woman was gone. The swan… gone.
Siegfried: And you don’t think you imagined it?
Roderich: My wounds are real enough. Something didn’t want me there. And whatever it was, it was strong.
Siegfried: You believe the woman and the swan are one and the same.
Roderich: What else could it be? A woman who vanishes without a trace? A swan where no swan should be? Some call it a spirit. Some say it’s a curse. Whatever it is… it’s watching.
Siegfried: Then it’s time I get some answers.
