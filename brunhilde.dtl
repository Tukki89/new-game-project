Siegfried: Brunhilde, I seek your counsel. My father has made his views clear, but I want to
hear yours. What do you think of what he told me?
Brunhilde: A king speaks as a king must. His words are not his own—they are the echoes of
every ruler before him.
Siegfried: And you? Do you believe duty must always come before the heart?
Brunhilde: I believe that what we want and what we must do are rarely the same thing.
Siegfried: So you agree with him. That love is a luxury, and that I should cast it aside for the
sake of the throne.
Brunhilde: I do not agree with him. But I understand him.
Siegfried: Then tell me, do you believe in love? Or is it just another chain?
Brunhilde: Love is not the chain, Siegfried. Duty is. Love is a fire, wild and unpredictable. But
duty—it is the hand that smothers the flame before it can burn too bright.
Siegfried: Then how do you bear it? How do you live knowing your life is not your own?
Brunhilde: You do not bear it. You endure it.
Siegfried: That is not living. That is merely surviving.
Brunhilde: And do you think kings live?
Siegfried: They should.
Brunhilde: Then you are chasing something few ever find.
Siegfried: And you? Did you ever have the chance to choose your own path?
Brunhilde: Once. A long time ago. In Villalibre, we were free, or at least we believed we were. I
fought alongside men, shaped my own future with my own hands. I was not some delicate thing
meant to be bartered away.
Siegfried: And yet, here you are.
Brunhilde: And yet, here I am.
Siegfried: Was it worth it? Trading your freedom for duty?
Brunhilde: Worth? That is not a question we are given the luxury to ask. My family needed me
to do what I did. It was never about worth—it was about necessity.
Siegfried: And you have no regrets?
Brunhilde: I have many. But regrets do not change the past.
Siegfried: My father speaks of duty as if it is an unbreakable law. That happiness is fleeting, but
obligation is eternal.
Brunhilde: He is right. And he is wrong.
Siegfried: How can it be both?
Brunhilde: Because happiness is fleeting, but so is everything else. Kingdoms rise and fall.
Dynasties crumble. Kings live and kings die. What remains? Our history. The choices we make.
The lives we touch. And the lives we will inspire in the future.
Siegfried: Then what of the nobility itself? Is it not built on a grand design? Some great plan
that has lasted through time?
Brunhilde: There is no grand design. Nobility is not the result of some divine order. It is nothing
more than the choices past rulers made—trial and error, until they struck something they
thought worked. Something they believed would preserve what was built before them.
Siegfried: A foundation of borrowed ideas and desperate choices.
Brunhilde: Exactly. Nobility is not as eternal as your father would have you believe. It survives
because it adapts. Because those in power find ways to justify their rule.
Siegfried: Then why do we cling to it? If it is nothing more than the weight of past decisions,
why do we still bend beneath it?
Brunhilde: Because to let go of it would mean admitting it was never as unshakable as we were
told.
Siegfried: You do not sound like a noble, Brunhilde.
Brunhilde: Perhaps that is because I never truly was one. Not in the way your father would
define it.
Siegfried: You speak of nobility as though it is an illusion. A fragile thing that could crumble if
only someone dared to question it.
Brunhilde: And is that not the truth? Look beyond the gold-lined halls, beyond the ceremonies
and titles. What is nobility but a story we tell to justify why some rule and others serve?
Siegfried: Then what would you have me do?
Brunhilde: That is not my decision to make. Only you know the weight of what you carry.
Siegfried: You sound as though you have already accepted your fate.
Brunhilde: I have. But that does not mean you must.
Siegfried: You say that, but if you had the chance—just one—would you take it? Would you
defy duty?
Brunhilde: If I had the chance… yes.
Siegfried: Then why did you not?
Brunhilde: Because it was not only my life at stake.
Siegfried: And if I choose love? If I choose my own path?
Brunhilde: Then be prepared for the consequences. The crown is not kind to those who defy it.
Siegfried: I refuse to be another ruler bound by chains of tradition.
Brunhilde: Then you will be a rare king indeed

Siegfried: Brunhilde speaks not as a noble, but as a warrior who lost her war.
Siegfried: A woman who once wielded her own fate, only to see it taken from her hands.
Siegfried: She understands my father’s words.
Siegfried: Not because she believes them, but because she has lived them.
Siegfried: She does not tell me to follow my duty.
Siegfried: She does not tell me to follow my heart.
Siegfried: She only warns me of the cost.
Siegfried: She has seen the truth of nobility—that it is not some sacred order, but a collection of choices,
Siegfried: stacked upon each other, until no one remembers who made the first.
Siegfried: She knows that power is not a birthright, but a story well told.
Siegfried: Freedom is a fragile thing.
Siegfried: A moment’s rebellion can be crushed beneath a lifetime of expectation.
Siegfried: She has accepted her fate.
Siegfried: But I will not accept mine.
Siegfried: If happiness is fleeting, then I will grasp it while I can.
Siegfried: If duty is eternal, then I will shape it on my own terms.
Siegfried: I will not be remembered as an empty king.
Siegfried: I will not let my name be spoken as another ruler who sacrificed everything for a throne.
