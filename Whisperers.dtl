Siegfried: Lord Waldheim. I have sought you out for your counsel.
Waldheim: A wise choice, young prince. Information is the most precious currency, after all.
Even a king is only as powerful as the truths he holds.
Siegfried: Then tell me—what truth do you see? My father has given me his answer, but I wish
to hear yours.
Waldheim: A dangerous habit, that. Seeking too many answers. The more truths you gather,
the harder it is to know which ones to trust.
Siegfried: That is why I have come to you.
Waldheim: Ah, flattery. A fine tool, if used well. But I suspect you are not here for tricks of the
tongue.
Siegfried: No. I want to know—what do you think of my father’s words? That duty must come
before all else?
Waldheim: Ah, duty. A noble word, wrapped in chains. Your father believes in it because it has
served him well. But tell me, do you know what duty truly is?
Siegfried: A ruler’s responsibility.
Waldheim: A convenient definition. But duty is a game, my prince. One where the rules are
written by those who came before you, and breaking them has a cost.
Siegfried: Then you believe I should follow them?
Waldheim: I believe you should understand them. Before you decide whether to obey or rewrite
them.
Siegfried: And what of love?
Waldheim: Ah. So that is the root of your turmoil. Love—the thorn in the crown. It is a beautiful
thing, yes. But a dangerous one. Love is a whisper that can undo empires, a flickering flame
that, if left unchecked, can burn down even the grandest of thrones.
Siegfried: Is that how you see it? A weakness?
Waldheim: A weakness? No. But power, true power, does not tolerate divided loyalties. A king
who belongs to love belongs to nothing else.
Siegfried: And yet, my father married the woman he loved.
Waldheim: A rare thing, indeed. Do you think that was fate? Some grand design?
Siegfried: You tell me.
Waldheim: No, young prince. It was not fate. It was merely chance—a fortunate alignment of
wants and duty, nothing more.
Siegfried: Then you believe nobility is not built on divine will, but on the choices of men?
Waldheim: Precisely. Kingdoms rise and fall, kings live and die. The world does not follow a
great plan, only the weight of decisions made long ago. The noble houses, the crown
itself—they are not eternal. They are accidents of history, preserved by those who benefit from
them.
Siegfried: Then why do we cling to them?
Waldheim: Because power fears the unknown. Change is chaos, and chaos is dangerous. But
let me ask you something, prince—do you believe a ruler should sacrifice himself for his
kingdom?
Siegfried: I… I do not know.
Waldheim: Then let me offer you a riddle.
Siegfried: A riddle?
Waldheim: A man is lost in a storm. The wind howls, the rain blinds him, and the path before
him splits in two. To the left, a road that will lead him safely home, but his people will starve. To
the right, a path that will save his people, but he will be lost to the storm forever. Which path
does he take?
Siegfried: That depends on the man.
Waldheim: Ah, now you are thinking. There is no correct answer—only the answer he can live
with.
Siegfried: But if he takes the safe road, his people suffer. If he takes the dangerous one, he is
gone. No matter what he chooses, something is lost.
Waldheim: Such is the nature of rule. Every choice comes with a sacrifice.
Siegfried: What if he refuses to choose? What if he stands there, unmoving, and waits for the
storm to pass?
Waldheim: Then he is no ruler. He is a man paralyzed by indecision, and his people will starve
all the same.
Siegfried: But if he throws himself into the storm, he is lost, and the kingdom may falter without
him.
Waldheim: Ah, now you begin to see. A king must know which cost he is willing to bear. The
cost of his own life? Or the cost of his people’s suffering?
Siegfried: And what would you choose?
Waldheim: Oh, my dear prince, I would never be foolish enough to get lost in the storm to begin
with.
Siegfried: You mean to say a true ruler does not let himself be caught between two impossible
choices.
Waldheim: Exactly. The clever king does not walk the paths given to him—he carves a new
one.
Siegfried: But what if there is no other path?
Waldheim: Then you must ask yourself, which price can you pay? The cost of your soul, or the
cost of your throne?
Siegfried: And what if I refuse to pay either?
Waldheim: Then you are either the greatest ruler this world has seen… or a fool who does not
understand the weight of the crown.
